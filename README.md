Learner Management System

Problem Statement:
How do we track learners at CLC events (workshops and classes), capture their demographic data, and measure the impact of these events? CLC would like to track age, gender, location, visible minority status, and previous CLC engagements. CLC would also like to track if these events have inspired learners to pursue a CS program or career.

CLC currently does not have a system to keep track of their learners and understand impact of their engagements to determine if their events have inspired learners to pursue a CS program or career.

Proposed Solution:

Develop a reliable and extensible ‘learner management system’ that provides functionality for CLC to generate insights about their users and provides ability to administer, track and report the delivery and impact of their events. The system would enable learners to ‘stay connected’ with CLC and also allow them to tap into the experience, talent and connection of all their co-learners and CLC volunteers to grow and progress their career.
